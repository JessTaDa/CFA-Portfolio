# Brief
To create a portfolio webpage that represented my journey through web development. The webpage would also be the main online outlet to display my work and portfolio. The webpage was to be developed using a rails framework and hosted via Heroku.

# Technology stack
The webpage was to be built to the best of our ability using tools and skills we have learnt during our 4 weeks at Coder Factory Academy. These included:
- Ruby
- Rails
- HTML
- CSS

# User stories
User and developer stories are important in the beginning of any design process, as to ensure the end product being developed meets its necessary requirements. User and developer stories were brainstormed and fleshed out in 'trello'. A snapshot of the process can be seen below.

# Concept design
# Ideation
A quick browse through web design examples showed that I was more attracted to colourful, minimalistic, and natural image designs.

# Experimentation
Equiped with this, I experimented with a range of themes, colours and backgrounds. The use of images was restricted to free liscences, so a few designs has to be changed. Initially, the theme had large use of geometric patterns and triangles.

Icons were sourced from:http://www.flaticon.com/
Images were sourced from: http://www.freepik.com/
Some images were made using GIMP

However, early user design feedback said that the use of geometric triangles design was a little outdated, and heavily popularised by Samsung in 2013-15. Hence, another design was sought.

After seeing much inspiration, I landed upon the "Hover Card" concept, by 'Captain Anonymous' https://codepen.io/anon/pen/evdwBM

This design was eventually added in as a main navigational component on my webpage. :)

# Writing the code
The first few iterations were not well planned out. Objects and classes were everywhere and CSS commands were added on objects and containers that didn't want them. Through several iterations, the website finally got working. 

# Outstanding issues
The current webpage is not ready for tablet or mobile view. Further iterations will take these sixing requirements into account.
